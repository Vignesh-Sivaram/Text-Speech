# TEXT ‚ÜîÔ∏è SPEECH CONVERSION WITH GOOGLE SEARCH INTEGRATION

In this project, we will see about Text to Speech as well as Speech to text conversion in a single webpage with the cool functionality of Google Search.

The languages supported for this conversion, are English and Tamil. 

This webpage project varies from Google Assisstant, by displaying the Tamil 'text from voice' instead of the transliterated Tamil text in English.

We can choose the language for voice search before the mic records our voice so that the text is displayed in the language accordingly.

# Webpage of the project:
